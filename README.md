   A speed conversion program that I coded with the Temperature Conversion program serving as the foundation.

   Able to convert Miles per hour, Kilometers per hour, Feet per second, Meter per second, and Knots
   Enter a number from 1 through 20 on the prompt screen to select the conversion option
   Once you are done with the program, type 'exit' or 'quit' into the prompt
   If you want to have some fun with the program, try typing in "speed demon" or "road runner".
